Libft - 42 School Project

Overview
This repository contains my implementation of Libft, the 
first core project at 42 School. The goal of this project 
is to recreate essential C standard library functions and 
build a custom C library from scratch, including bonus 
features. The Libft project served as an opportunity to 
deepen my understanding of C programming, memory 
management, and algorithmic thinking.

What I Learned
C Standard Library Functions: Recreated functions like strlen,
memset, strcpy, and more, improving my understanding of how 
they work internally.

Memory Management: Gained experience with dynamic memory 
allocation (malloc) and safe deallocation (free), ensuring 
proper memory usage.

Pointer Manipulation: Worked extensively with pointers, 
developing skills in pointer arithmetic, dereferencing, 
and managing strings and dynamic memory.

Code Optimization: Focused on optimizing functions for both
time and space efficiency, learning to balance performance 
and simplicity.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling for edge 
cases such as NULL pointers, empty strings, and large inputs.

Modular Programming: Developed modular code with clean, 
reusable functions, using proper project structure with 
headers and a Makefile.

Bonus Features
In addition to the mandatory functions, I implemented bonus 
functions, including:

Linked List Functions: Created utility functions to manipulate 
linked lists, such as ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_back, and more.

Structs: Used to define custom data types for linked list nodes 
and other data structures, enhancing your ability to model 
complex data.

Files Overview
libft.h: Header file containing function prototypes and macros.
*.c files: Source code for all the implemented functions.
Makefile: Makefile to compile the library.
